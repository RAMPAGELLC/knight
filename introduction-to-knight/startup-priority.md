# Startup Priority

In version 0.0.7-prod we added startup priority. By default the following groups have the priority of;

Internal = 4

Objects = 3

Services = 2



A higher priority = startup first. Default priority is 1, if a module does not have a pre-defined priority one will be automatically assigned stated above or defaults to 1.
