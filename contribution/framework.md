### Lua Styleguide

* Use 4 Space indentation
* Don't create unnecessary threads. always try to find a better method of triggering events
* Don't repeat yourself.. if you're using the same operations in many different places convert them into a function with flexible variables
* For distance checking loops set longer waits if you're outside of a range
* Job specific loops should only run for players with that job, don't waste cycles
* When possible don't trust the client, especially with transactions
* Balance security and optimizations
* [Consider this Lua Performance guide](https://springrts.com/wiki/Lua\_Performance)
* Use local variables everywhere possible
* Make use of `KNIGHT_CONFIG` where it makes sense making features optional or customizable
