# Installation

Knight is a lightweight framework for organizing your Roblox game code using services and clean architecture.

There are **three ways** to install Knight in your project:

***

## Option 1: Clone via Git

If you're comfortable with Git, clone the Knight repository directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAMPAGELLC/knight.git
```

***

## Option 2: Use Knight CLI

If you have the **Knight CLI** installed globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @rampage/knight
```

### You can scaffold a new project with:

```bash
knight init
```

This creates a pre-structured Knight project with client, server, and shared folders ready to go. You can also use it to generate new services and controllers.

> âœ… Tip: Run `knight --help` to explore all CLI options.

***

## Option 3: Download RBXL Binary

Prefer a plug-and-play Studio file? Download the `.rbxl` place file from the GitHub Releases:

ðŸ‘‰ [Knight GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RAMPAGELLC/knight/releases)

Choose the latest version and open it directly in Roblox Studio to explore or build on top of it.

***
