# What are folders

You can find a folder similar to this screenshot in StarterPlayerScripts for Client, ReplicatedStorage for Shared, and ServerStorage for Server.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

Services folders are used to contain services. Go here to learn about [services.md](services.md "mention").

You can create as much folders as you please such as a Objects folder, asset folder, etc. Or even folders under folders. There is no limit & it can be indexed the same.

```lua
Knight.MyCustomFolder.AnotherCoolFolder.AndAnother.CoolModule.bar()
```

## How you utilize folders and stylize is up to you!
